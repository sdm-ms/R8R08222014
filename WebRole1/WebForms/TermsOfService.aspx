R8R Terms of Service
</asp:Content>
<asp:Content ID="Content5" ContentPlaceHolderID="ContentMain" Runat="Server">
By accessing and using R8R, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and
    provision of the Terms of Service, as well as to any other rules posted on particular
    parts of R8R website or affiliated websites that you use.<br>
    <br>
    You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a
    person barred from using R8R under the laws of the United States or other applicable
    jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete
    information about yourself as prompted by R8R registration form (the "Registration
    Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true,
    accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,
    not current or incomplete, or R8R has reasonable grounds to suspect that such
    information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, R8R has the right
    to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use
    of R8R (or any portion thereof).<br>
    <br>
    You agree that you will sign up for no more than 1 R8R account. You further
    agree that you will not transfer your account to another, with or without compensation.<br>
    <br>
    You agree that you will in no way try to manipulate or defraud the rating and prediction
    system established by R8R. This includes, but is not limited to, entering false
    or incomplete account information, using a misleading username, using multiple accounts
    and/or computers to enter ratings or predictions, engaging in collusion with other
    R8R participants, disseminating false or misleading information, disseminating
    information outside of R8R website in a manner designed to influence participants
    on R8R, entering ratings or predictions without basis in fact, and attempting
    to time your ratings and predictions so that others will not have the chance to
    review them. You further agree that if R8R believes that there is any chance
    that you have engaged in any manipulation or fraud, R8R may suspend or terminate
    your account and refuse any and all current or future use of R8R (or any portion
    thereof).<br>
    <br>
    You further agree that R8R may suspend or terminate your account for any reason
    whatsoever, including caprice, negligence, recklessness, request from law enforcement
    services, unexpected technical or security issues, bandwidth limitations, or financial
    problems at R8R. In addition, you agree that R8R may, when suspending or
    terminating your account or without doing so, change your point totals or ensure
    that you do not receive any cash payments or other prizes based on points already
    or in the future accumulated. You agree that the decision to take these actions
    is solely R8R’s and that you shall have no cause of action based on decisions
    to change point totals or to prevent you from having a chance to win any cash or
    other prize offered on R8R.<br>
    <br>
    You agree that by using R8R or by entering ratings and predictions on the site,
    or by making changes to R8R database tables, you retain no legal right, interest,
    or ownership, to any ratings or data entered on the site, or to any points or prizes
    that R8R represents that you might win as a result of entering ratings or predictions
    on the site. You agree that R8R is not bound to continue to follow the rules
    on its site governing the distribution of points and/or cash and/or other prizes,
    and that it may change them at any time, with or without warning, and that it may
    do so retroactively. For example, R8R may decide to adopt new formulas for determining
    the points to be allocated to those who have entered ratings or predictions, or
    to those who have made database changes. In addition, R8R may decide, for example
    because of technical failure, unavailability of funds, or legal restrictions or
    concerns, not to give prizes that it indicated on its site that it would give.<br>
    <br>
    You agree that if you enter ratings or predictions, that does not provide you with
    a legal right to receipt of any payment or prizes from R8R. You further agree
    that you have no right to have points for ratings or forecasts you enter calculated
    with any accuracy, and R8R reserves the right to use any approach that it chooses
    to calculate points and to determine the correct outcome of events that have been
    occurred and that have been rated, even if R8R’s determinations are manifestly
    unreasonable. Any taxes that you are subject to are your responsibility. Further,
    you agree to provide any tax forms that R8R requires before any cash or prizes
    are paid to you, and that R8R may cancel any prizes provided to you if these
    are not provided according to a timetable to be set by R8R. Finally, you agree
    that R8R may decide not to make any payments to individuals below a certain
    age, or outside the United States; even if R8R has not made such a decision
    yet, it may do so retroactively.<br>
    <br>
    Registration Data and certain other information about you are subject to our applicable
    privacy policy. You understand that through your use of R8R, you consent to
    the Tbl and use (as set forth in the applicable privacy policy) of this information,
    including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries

    disclaimer of warranties above remains fully and completely applicable. R8R
    is provided for informational purposes only, and no Content included in R8R
    is intended for trading, investing, or other commercial purposes. R8R and its
    licensors shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness or availability

    <br>
    NOTICE<br>
    <br>
    R8R may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the TOS,
    including by but not limited to email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message, postings
    on R8R, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed. Such notices
    may not be received if you violate this TOS by accessing R8R in an unauthorized
    manner. Your agreement to this TOS constitutes your agreement that you are deemed
    to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed
    R8R in an authorized manner.
    <br>
    <br>
    You agree that all of R8R’s trademarks, trade names, service marks and other
    R8R logos and brand features, and product and service names are trademarks and
    the property of R8R Inc. (the "R8R Marks"). Without R8R's prior permission,
    you agree not to display or use in any manner R8R Marks.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    and governs your use of R8R, superseding any prior version of this TOS between
    you and R8R with respect to R8R. You also may be subject to additional terms
    and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other R8R, affiliate

    action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the TOS,
    or the relationship between you and R8R, shall be brought exclusively in the
    courts located in the county of Arlington, Virginia or the U.S. District Court for
    the Eastern District of Virginia. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
    of the courts located within the county of Arlington, Virginia or the Eastern District
    of Virginia, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction
    over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.<br>
    <br>
    Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of R8R to exercise or enforce
    any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
    to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to
    give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
    provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.<br>
    <br>
    Interpretation. Any ambiguity in this agreement shall be interpreted in favor of
    R8R, and in any event not against R8R.<br>
    <br>
    No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your R8R account
    is non-transferable and any rights to your R8R ID or contents within your account
    terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account
    may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.<br>
    <br>
    Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary,
    any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of R8R or the
    TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
    or be forever barred.<br>
